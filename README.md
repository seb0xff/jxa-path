JXA Path

This is a simple JXA wrapper over a little confusing official API.
It provides basic functionality to work with paths like: join, parentDirectory, basename

## Usage

> It is intended to be used with JXA and built using [jxa-builder](https://github.com/seb0xff/jxa-builder)

```bash
npm i jxa-path
```

```javascript
const ph = Library("jxa-path");
...
```
